# Welcome to your coursework planner

This is how you will plan and manage your coursework at CYF. You will add all your work as issues to your fork of this repository, and then use a [project board](https://github.com/orgs/HackYourFutureBelgium/projects/15/views/1) to manage your work. This is broadly how all technical projects are managed, so you will need lots of practice. Get started today.

## 1. How to get set up

#### Forking the My-Coursework-Planner repo

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/My-Coursework-Planner) to your own GitHub

3. That's it! You're ready to start adding issues to your board!

## 2. In every module, you will add your work as issues

Each week in each module has a `To-do list of the week` page which lists the work you're expected to do for that module. Every item in the list is actually a GitHub issue.

Copy issues for each week or at most for each module. The coursework content is updated frequently, you will not have the most up to date tasks on your board if you copy all modules at once.

Each module has a module repo. The coursework for each module is added as issues to that repository. All the module repos are listed in the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/Intro-to-Programming).

1. Go to the module repo
2. Click on the `Issues` tab
3. Copy each issue from the module repo to your own coursework repo.
4. Do not forget to add labels.

## 3. Manage and adapt your project board as you learn

You should use the _same project board_ all the way through the course, and add to it as you go, learn as you go, and adapt your board as you learn.

You can, and should, also add your own tickets to the board. Just remember it's a public board, so don't add anything you don't want to share with your mentors.
